								<h1>Why Choosing the Right Storage Infrastructure</h1>
							</header>

							<p>
							There’s been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX upright rocket landing. Simple as it seems, the excitementSci-Fi Today, Reality TV Tomorrow, at least for me, stems from how the feat has brought us one step closer to fulfilling our sci-fi fantasies – etched into our minds by the many blockbuster flicks Hollywood has produced. If you can recall one of the opening scenes of The Martian, we witnessed the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) lifting off, attempting to escape an ensuing dust storm. While most of the focus was on the misfortune of Mark Watney – played by Matt Damon, left behind after being struck by debris, you could say we took for granted how easily the MAV ascended into space. Combine the thought of how the MAV got there in the first place, and you have yourself a similar parallel to the SpaceX launch and landing. So what am I getting at? Science fiction only remains science fiction until technology catches up with our imagination. This applies not just to space travel, but every other area of technological advancement. Whether we realize it or not, spectacular scientific breakthroughs can be found in the very heart of our homes. Let’s take TVs for example. Ask your grandparents whether they’d have thought color TV was ever possible in the age of black & white screens. In retrospect, many may not have expressed such optimism. Then there were the early 2000s when industry pioneers sold us the idea of being able to spot every blade of grass on the football pitch as the advent of high definition TV dawned upon us. Industry naysayers expressed serious doubt as such a transition would have required a major overhaul to equipment and broadcast standards.
