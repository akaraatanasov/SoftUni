								<h1>Why Choosing the Right Storage Infrastructure</h1>
							</header>

							<p>
							There’s been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX upright rocket landing. Simple as it seems, the excitementSci-Fi Today, Reality TV Tomorrow, at least for me, stems from how the feat has brought us one step closer to fulfilling our sci-fi fantasies – etched into our minds by the many blockbuster flicks Hollywood has produced. If you can recall one of the opening scenes of The Martian, we witnessed the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) lifting off, attempting to escape an ensuing dust storm. While most of the focus was on the misfortune of Mark Watney – played by Matt Damon, left behind after being struck by debris, you could say we took for granted how easily the MAV ascended into space. Combine the thought of how the MAV got there in the first place, and you have yourself a similar parallel to the SpaceX launch and landing. So what am I getting at? Science fiction only remains science fiction until technology catches up with our imagination. This applies not just to space travel, but every other area of technological advancement.

								<h1>From Concept to Ubiquity to Competitiveness</h1>

							Well, tell that today to any one of Thailand’s seven high definition (HD) digital television channels. Yes, not one but seven. One of which is Amarin TV. It operates a satellite television broadcasting channel, produces television content for free TV channels, and broadcasts edu-tainment content through its Amarin Activ TV channel; all in HD. There are two common issues that plague the delivery of HD content: space and speed. Have you ever tried transferring gigabytes of information from your computer into an external hard drive? If you have, you’ll understand “the wait”. Now imagine, HD content requires a broadcast station to deliver gigabytes of content every few seconds just so you get that impeccable quality on your TV screen. Amarin TV needed a storage solution that would improve the speed of its post-production content editing, deliver reliability, and scale rapidly without causing interruptions to service operations. After implanting an EMC Isilon scale-out network-attached storage (NAS) platform, Amarin improved operational efficiency by up to 10 times and reduced its production costs.
